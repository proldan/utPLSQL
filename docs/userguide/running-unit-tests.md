utPLSQL framework provides two main entry points to run unit tests from within database: 
- `ut.run` procedures and functions
- `ut_runner.run` procedures

Those two entry points differ in purpose and behavior.

# ut.run
Package `ut` contains overloaded procedures and functions `run`.
The `run` API is designed to be called directly by developer, when using IDE/SQL console to execute unit tests.
The main benefit of using this API is it's simplicity.
One-line call is enough to execute a set of tests form one or multiple schemes.

The **procedures** execute specified tests and produces outputs to DBMS_OUTPUT using specified reporter
The **functions** can only be used in SELECT statements. They execute specified tests and produce outputs as a pipelined data stream to be consumed by select satement.

## ut.run procedures

Examples:
```sql
alter session set current_schema=hr;
begin
  ut.run();
end;
```
Execute all tests in current schema (_HR_).


```sql
begin
  ut.run('HR');
end;
```
Execute all tests in specified schema (_HR_).


```sql
begin
  ut.run('hr:com.my_org.my_project');
end;
```

Execute all tests from all packages that are on the _COM.MY_ORG.MY_PROJECT_ suitepath.
Check the [annotations documentation](annotations.md) to find out about suitepaths and how they can be used to group test packages.


```sql
begin
  ut.run('hr.test_apply_bonus');
end;
```
Execute all tests from package _HR.TEST_APPLY_BONUS_. 


```sql
begin
  ut.run('hr.test_apply_bonus.bonus_cannot_be_negative');
end;
```
Execute single test procedure _HR.TEST_APPLY_BONUS.BONUS_CANNOT_BE_NEGATIVE_.


```sql
begin
  ut.run(ut_varcahr2_list('hr.test_apply_bonus','cust'));
end;
```
Execute all tests from package _HR.TEST_APPLY_BONUS_ and all tests from schema _CUST_.
Using a list of items to execute allows you to execute a fine-grained set of tests.


**Note:**
`ut_documentation_reporter` is default reporter for all API's defined for running unit tests.

The `ut.run` procedures and functions accept `a_reporter` attribute that defines the reporter to be used in the run.
You can execute any set of tests with any of the predefined reporters.

```sql
begin
  ut.run('hr.test_apply_bonus', ut_xunit_reporter());
end;
```
Execute all tests from package _HR.TEST_APPLY_BONUS_ and provide outputs to DBMS_OUTPUT using the XUnit reporter. 


For details on build-in reporters look at [reporters documentation](reporters.md).

## ut.run functions

The `ut.run` functions provide exactly the same functionality as the procedures. You may use the same sets of parameters with both functions and procedures. The only difference is the output of the results.
Functions provide outputs as pipelined stream and therefore need to be executed as select statements.

Example.
```sql
select * from table(ut.run('hr.test_apply_bonus', ut_xunit_reporter()));
```

# ut_runner.run

The `ut_runner` provides API for integrating utPLSQL with other products. Maven, Jenkins, SQL Develper, PL/SQL Developer, TOAD and others can leverage this API to call utPLSQL.

The main difference as compared to `ut.run` API is that the `ut_runner.run` does not print outputs to the screen.

`ut_runner.run` accepts multiple reporters. Each reporter produces outputs into a separate output (uniquely identified by output_id).
Outputs of multiple reporters can be consumed in parallel. This allows for live reporting of test execution progress with threads and several database sessions.

The concept is pretty simple.

- in the main thread (session), define the reporters to be used. Each reporter has it's output_id and so you need to extract and store those output_id's.
- as a separate thread, start the `ut_runner.run` and pass reporters with previously defined output_id's
- for each reporter start a separate thread and read outputs from `ut_output_buffer.get_lines` table function by providing the output_id defined in the main thread.

`ut_runner.run` is internally used by the [`ut_run.sql` script](ut_run-script.md) which is a utility for running tests with multiple reporters and provides parameters to save reporters results into individual files on the local file system.
